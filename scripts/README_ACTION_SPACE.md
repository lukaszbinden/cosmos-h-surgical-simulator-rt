# Cosmos-H-Surgical-Simulator: Unified 44D Action Space for Open-H Multi-Embodiment Training

This document describes the design of the unified 44-dimensional action
conditioning space used by the Cosmos Predict-2.5 world model when fine-tuned
on the [Open-H](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Open-H) multi-embodiment
surgical robotics benchmark.  It also details how non-CMR embodiments map their
native action spaces into the shared 44D vector via zero-padding, and documents
the data mixture that governs how each dataset contributes to training.

## Design Motivation

Cosmos Predict-2.5 is an action-conditioned video generation model.  Given a
context frame and a sequence of action vectors, it generates a video predicting
the future visual state of the environment.  The Open-H fine-tune trains a
single model across **9 distinct robot embodiments** from **10+ institutions**,
each with different kinematic configurations, sensor setups, and action
representations.

A unified action dimension is required because:

1. **Batched training** — PyTorch's `DataLoader` collates samples via
   `torch.stack`, which requires all action tensors in a batch to have the
   same shape.
2. **Single model** — The Cosmos diffusion transformer's action MLP accepts a
   fixed-size input.  All embodiments must project into the same vector space.
3. **Dominant embodiment anchor** — CMR Surgical Versius contributes the largest
   and most complex action space (44D), so all other embodiments are
   zero-padded up to this dimension.

The constant `MAX_ACTION_DIM = 44` is defined in
[`groot_configs.py`](../cosmos_predict2/_src/predict2/action/datasets/gr00t_dreams/groot_configs.py)
and is used throughout the pipeline.

---

## The 44D Action Vector

The unified action vector is a **per-timestep** tensor of shape `(44,)`.
During training, 12 such vectors are provided per sample (one per prediction
frame), resulting in an action tensor of shape `(12, 44)`.

### CMR Versius Breakdown (Full 44D)

CMR Versius is the only embodiment that uses all 44 dimensions.  Its action
vector decomposes into two logical groups:

#### Actions (30D) — Dimensions 0–29

| Dim Range | Size | Key | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–8 | 9 | `action.left_pose` | Left arm EEF: xyz_rel (3) + rot6d_rel (6) |
| 9 | 1 | `action.left_gripper` | Left gripper opening (absolute) |
| 10–18 | 9 | `action.right_pose` | Right arm EEF: xyz_rel (3) + rot6d_rel (6) |
| 19 | 1 | `action.right_gripper` | Right gripper opening (absolute) |
| 20 | 1 | `action.left_energy` | Left energy button (binary, zeroed during clutch-out) |
| 21 | 1 | `action.right_energy` | Right energy button (binary, zeroed during clutch-out) |
| 22 | 1 | `action.thumbstick_x_left` | Left thumbstick X-axis (continuous, pass-through) |
| 23 | 1 | `action.thumbstick_x_right` | Right thumbstick X-axis (continuous, pass-through) |
| 24 | 1 | `action.thumbstick_y_left` | Left thumbstick Y-axis (continuous, pass-through) |
| 25 | 1 | `action.thumbstick_y_right` | Right thumbstick Y-axis (continuous, pass-through) |
| 26 | 1 | `action.thumbstickBtn_left` | Left thumbstick button (binary, pass-through) |
| 27 | 1 | `action.thumbstickBtn_right` | Right thumbstick button (binary, pass-through) |
| 28 | 1 | `action.clutchBtn_left` | Left clutch button (binary, pass-through) |
| 29 | 1 | `action.clutchBtn_right` | Right clutch button (binary, pass-through) |

#### State Conditioning (14D) — Dimensions 30–43

These are observation-state variables sampled at action timesteps and appended
to the action vector for MLP conditioning.  They are **not** transformed into
deltas — they are passed through as absolute values.

| Dim Range | Size | Key | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | 1 | `action.cond_hapticengaged_left` | Left haptic engagement (persistent state) |
| 31 | 1 | `action.cond_hapticengaged_right` | Right haptic engagement (persistent state) |
| 32 | 1 | `action.cond_armlinkedtohaptic_left` | Left controller → arm link (0–3) |
| 33 | 1 | `action.cond_armlinkedtohaptic_right` | Right controller → arm link (0–3) |
| 34 | 1 | `action.cond_arm_0_instrtype` | Arm 0 instrument type |
| 35 | 1 | `action.cond_arm_1_instrtype` | Arm 1 instrument type |
| 36 | 1 | `action.cond_arm_2_instrtype` | Arm 2 instrument type |
| 37 | 1 | `action.cond_arm_3_instrtype` | Arm 3 instrument type |
| 38 | 1 | `action.cond_arm_0_color` | Arm 0 HUD color |
| 39 | 1 | `action.cond_arm_1_color` | Arm 1 HUD color |
| 40 | 1 | `action.cond_arm_2_color` | Arm 2 HUD color |
| 41 | 1 | `action.cond_arm_3_color` | Arm 3 HUD color |
| 42 | 1 | `action.cond_electroSurgeryMode_left` | Left electrosurgery mode (CUT/COAG) |
| 43 | 1 | `action.cond_electroSurgeryMode_right` | Right electrosurgery mode (CUT/COAG) |

### Action Representation Formats

Each action key uses one of four representation modes (configured via
`ActionKeyConfig` in `state_action.py`):

| Representation | Description | Output Dim | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rel_xyz_rot6d` | Translation relative to reference EEF, rotation relative to initial orientation expressed as 6D rotation. Converts any input rotation format (quaternion, Euler, rot6d) to a unified 9D output: xyz (3) + rot6d (6). | 9 | EEF pose keys (most embodiments) |
| `relative` | Simple subtraction from reference state: `action - state_ref`. | Same as input | Joint-space actions (USTC Torin) |
| `delta` | Data is already a delta — pass through unchanged. | Same as input | Moon Surgical |
| `absolute` | No delta conversion. Used for grippers, energy buttons, etc. | Same as input | Grippers, binary controls |

The 6D rotation representation follows the **column convention** from
*Zhou et al., "On the Continuity of Rotation Representations in Neural
Networks"*: the first two columns of the 3x3 rotation matrix are flattened
as `[r00, r10, r20, r01, r11, r21]`.

---

## Non-CMR Embodiment Mapping

Every non-CMR embodiment produces a **native action dimension** that is
smaller than 44D.  After per-embodiment transforms (delta conversion,
normalization, concatenation), the resulting action tensor is zero-padded to
44D by `MixedLeRobotDataset.__getitem__()`.

### Summary Table

The table below shows the post-transform (model-facing) action dimension for
each embodiment, before zero-padding.
It includes the full Open-H embodiment registry; the default
`OPEN_H_DATASET_SPECS` training mixture uses a subset (9 embodiments).

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cmr_versius` | **44** | 0 | CMR Surgical Versius | 2x pose(9D) + 2x gripper(1D) + energy(2D) + thumbstick(6D) + clutch(2D) + state_cond(14D) |

### Per-Embodiment Details

#### Dual-Arm EEF + Gripper (20D)

This is the most common pattern, shared by 8 embodiments (dVRK JHU, UCB,
Obuda, Stanford, UCSD, Hamlyn, LSCR MIRACLE, LSCR SMARTS).  Each uses the
helper function `_dual_arm_eef_configs()` in `groot_configs.py`:

```
Arm 1: pose (9D via rel_xyz_rot6d) + gripper (1D absolute) = 10D
Arm 2: pose (9D via rel_xyz_rot6d) + gripper (1D absolute) = 10D
Total: 20D → [20D data | 24D zeros]
```

The input rotation format varies by institution (quaternion xyzw, quaternion
wxyz, or Euler RPY) but the output is always 9D (xyz + rot6d) after the
`GenericRelativeActionTransform`.

#### Rob Surgical (36D)

The Rob Surgical bitrack system has 4 arms and no grippers:

```
left_pose (9D) + right_pose (9D) + lap_pose (9D) + aux_pose (9D) = 36D
Total: 36D → [36D data | 8D zeros]
```

Input rotations are in Euler format, converted to rot6d.

#### Turin MITIC (18D)

Dual-arm dVRK without gripper channels:

```
psm1_pose (9D) + psm2_pose (9D) = 18D
Total: 18D → [18D data | 26D zeros]
```

#### USTC Torin (Joint-Space, Variable)

Uses joint-angle actions with `relative` subtraction instead of
`rel_xyz_rot6d`.  The dimension depends on the number of joints per arm in
the underlying dataset (typically 6 DOF each):

```
left_joints (ND) + right_joints (ND) = 2ND (varies)
Total: 2ND → [2ND data | (44-2N)D zeros]
```

#### Single-Arm Systems (10D)

PolyU Simulated and TUD TUNDRA each have a single arm:

```
pose (9D via rel_xyz_rot6d) + gripper (1D absolute) = 10D
Total: 10D → [10D data | 34D zeros]
```

#### Moon Surgical (6D)

Moon Surgical provides only delta-XYZ translations, no rotations or grippers:

```
right_arm_delta_xyz (3D) + left_arm_delta_xyz (3D) = 6D
Total: 6D → [6D data | 38D zeros]
```

---

## Zero-Padding Mechanism

Zero-padding is applied in `MixedLeRobotDataset.__getitem__()` in
[`dataset.py`](../cosmos_predict2/_src/predict2/action/datasets/gr00t_dreams/data/dataset.py):

```python
action = lerobot_data["action"]
if isinstance(action, torch.Tensor):
    current_dim = action.shape[-1]
    if current_dim < self.max_action_dim:
        padding = torch.zeros(
            *action.shape[:-1], self.max_action_dim - current_dim,
            dtype=action.dtype, device=action.device,
        )
        action = torch.cat([action, padding], dim=-1)
```

This ensures every sample, regardless of embodiment, produces an action tensor
of shape `(12, 44)` — 12 action timesteps, each 44-dimensional.

Zero-padding is semantically neutral: zero values in the trailing dimensions
represent "no signal" for those action channels.  CMR is the only embodiment
that uses the full 44D layout including the 14D state-conditioning tail
(dimensions 30–43).  Some non-CMR embodiments (for example `rob_surgical` at
36D) can also occupy positions beyond dimension 20, but all dimensions above an
embodiment's native width are padded with zeros.

Similarly, **state tensors** (`__key__`) are zero-padded to a common maximum
state dimension across all embodiments to satisfy DataLoader collation.

---

## Transform Pipeline

Each embodiment has its own transform pipeline that runs **before** zero-padding.
The pipeline is built by `construct_modality_config_and_transforms()` in
[`groot_configs.py`](../cosmos_predict2/_src/predict2/action/datasets/gr00t_dreams/groot_configs.py).

### Generic (Non-CMR) Pipeline

Built by `_build_generic_config_and_transforms()`:

```
1. VideoToTensor         → Convert video frames to tensors
2. VideoCrop (train)     → Random 95% crop for augmentation
3. VideoResize           → Resize to target resolution (e.g. 512x288)
4. StateActionToTensor   → Convert ALL state keys to tensors
5. StateActionToTensor   → Convert action keys to tensors
6. GenericRelativeAction → Delta conversion (rel_xyz_rot6d / relative / delta)
7. StateActionTransform  → Normalize state keys (mean_std)
8. StateActionTransform  → Normalize action keys (mean_std)
9. ConcatTransform       → Concatenate into single state/action vectors
```

Step 6 (`GenericRelativeActionTransform`) is the key step that converts raw
absolute actions into relative representations.  It dispatches per-key based
on the `ActionKeyConfig`:

- **`rel_xyz_rot6d`** keys call `convert_to_hybrid_relative()` — this reads
  the reference EEF pose from the state, computes relative translation and
  rotation, and outputs 9D (xyz + rot6d).
- **`relative`** keys subtract the reference state (joint-space).
- **`delta`** and **`absolute`** keys pass through unchanged.

### CMR Versius Pipeline

The CMR pipeline is more complex due to clutch-aware processing:

```
1. VideoToTensor
2. VideoCrop (train) / VideoResize
3. StateActionToTensor (state)
4. StateActionToTensor (action)
5. CMRVersiusRelativeActionTransform:
   a. Hybrid-relative pose conversion with engagement-awareness
   b. Motion scaling (hand-controller-space → instrument-space)
   c. Gripper sample-and-hold during clutch-out
   d. Energy zeroing during clutch-out
   e. Thumbstick / state conditioning pass-through
   f. Remove temporary pass-through keys
6. StateActionTransform (state normalization, mean_std)
7. StateActionTransform (action normalization, mean_std)
8. ConcatTransform
```

The `CMRVersiusRelativeActionTransform` (in
[`state_action.py`](../cosmos_predict2/_src/predict2/action/datasets/gr00t_dreams/data/transform/state_action.py))
handles several CMR-specific concerns:

- **Engagement-aware delta re-integration** — Instead of naive
  `pose[t] - pose[ref]`, it accumulates only engaged deltas:
  `sum(delta[i] * engaged[i] for i in ref+1..t)`.  This prevents phantom
  jumps from surgeon repositioning during clutch-out.
- **Motion scaling** — Multiplies translation deltas by the Versius
  `translation_scaling` factor and scales rotation angles by
  `rotation_scaling` to convert from hand-controller coordinates to
  instrument-tip coordinates.
- **Sample-and-hold** for grippers during clutch-out (the gripper retains its
  last engaged value).
- **Energy zeroing** during clutch-out for safety (energy buttons are forced
  to zero when the arm is disengaged).

### Normalization

All embodiments use **mean-std (z-score) normalization** for both state and
action channels.  Statistics are pre-computed per dataset and stored in
Cosmos-specific stats files.  For non-CMR Open-H embodiments this is
`meta/stats_cosmos.json`; for CMR Versius this is
`meta/stats_cosmos-44D.json`.  CMR stats are computed over the 9D
hybrid-relative pose format (not the raw 7D quaternion format), which is why a
separate CMR-specific stats file is required.

---

## Data Mixture

### Weighting Strategy

The Open-H data mixture is adapted from the gr00t-H exp62/exp86 training
configurations.  The weighting strategy allocates:

- **CMR Versius: 50%** of total training compute (mix_ratio sum = 4.0 across
  4 procedures)
- **All other embodiments: 50%** of total training compute (mix_ratio sum =
  4.0), distributed proportionally by frame count (**step-weighted**)

The step-weighted normalization for non-CMR datasets is:

$$
\text{mix\_ratio}_i = \frac{\text{frames}_i}{\text{total\_non\_CMR\_frames} \;/\; 4.0}
$$

With `total_non_CMR_frames = 5,488,040`, the normalization factor is
`1,372,010`.

### Exclusions

The following datasets are **excluded** from the Open-H Cosmos mixture:

- **TUM Ultrasound** — ultrasound modality, not surgical endoscopic video

Within included datasets, certain splits are filtered:
- Stanford Needle Transfer: `fail` and `bad_frames` splits excluded
- Stanford Peg Transfer: `fail` split excluded
- Turin MITIC: `failure` split excluded
- LSCR ARCADE cautery: `missing_videos` split excluded

### Training Statistics

For the default Open-H run (8 nodes / 64 GPUs, batch size 16), logs report:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Virtual training samples (after repeat upsampling) | 228,122,609 |
| Virtual test samples (95/5 split counterpart) | 12,006,812 |
| Approx. unique real samples (full mixture, before repeat) | ~4.9M |
| Global batch size | 64 GPUs x 16 = 1,024 |
| Steps per epoch | ~222,776 |
| Dataset partition | 95% train / 5% test |
| Number of embodiments | 9 |
| Video resolution | 512x288 (16:9) |
| Video frames per sample | 13 (1 context + 12 prediction) |
| Action timesteps per sample | 12 |

The `MixedLeRobotDataset` implements weighted sampling via **repeat factors**:
smaller datasets are repeated more times per epoch so that their contribution
to training matches the desired `mix_ratio`.  For example, with only 516 real
samples, the Moon dataset is repeated ~29x while the large CMR procedures are
repeated 1–2x.

## Overview

Cosmos-H-Surgical-Simulator is a surgical-domain variant of [Cosmos Predict2.5](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5) that generates future video frames conditioned on robot actions and an initial surgical scene. Given a context frame from a surgical procedure and a sequence of action vectors describing instrument kinematics, the model predicts realistic video of the resulting surgical environment — enabling applications in surgical simulation, pre-operative planning, and robotic training. For video prediction and control-conditioned transfer without action conditioning, see the companion repo [Cosmos-H-Surgical](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Medtech/Cosmos-H-Surgical).

The model supports **9 distinct robot embodiments** across **10+ institutions**, with all embodiment action spaces mapped into a unified 44-dimensional action vector. The CMR Versius system serves as the primary embodiment. See [README_ACTION_SPACE.md](scripts/README_ACTION_SPACE.md) for the full action space design.

The underlying architecture is a flow-based diffusion transformer that unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation into a single model, using Cosmos-Reason1 as the text encoder. This surgical variant extends the base Predict2.5 capabilities with domain-specific fine-tuning on real surgical video data.

## News

- **[April 2026]** — Bugfix: properly initialize action embedder MLPs (`action_embedder_B_D` / `action_embedder_B_3D`) after loading the base checkpoint, so their weights are no longer left at zero under FSDP meta-device materialization.
- **[March 2026]** — Released Cosmos-H-Surgical-Simulator for the [Open-H benchmark](#open-h-benchmark)

For Cosmos-Predict2.5 updates, see the [upstream changelog](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Predict2.5).

## Open-H Benchmark

Training uses **32 datasets across 9 embodiments** from the [Open-H](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Open-H) collection, stored in [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) format. The data mixture allocates 50% of training compute to CMR Versius (4 surgical procedures) and 50% to all other embodiments (step-weighted by frame count).

| Group | Datasets | Approx. Frames | Training Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| CMR Versius | cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, inguinal hernia, prostatectomy | ~17M | 50% |
| dVRK JHU | porcine chole, electrocautery, suturebot (x3), tissue, needle, suturing | ~2.8M | 25% |
| Stanford Real | Needle Transfer, Tissue Retraction, Peg Transfer | ~874K | 8% |
| Hamlyn Centre | Suturing (x2), peg transfer, needle, knot tying, tissue retraction | ~545K | 5% |
| Turin MITIC | mitic_lerobot_ex_vivo | ~389K | 3.5% |
| UCSD | surgical_learning_dataset (x2) | ~315K | 3% |
| UCB | debridement_lerobot | ~222K | 2% |
| USTC Torin | knot tying, needle handover, needle pickup | ~185K | 1.7% |
| LSCR ARCADE | Cholecystectomy, cautery | ~183K | 1.7% |
| Moon Surgical | moon | ~12K | 0.1% |

Training configuration: 8 nodes / 64 GPUs, batch size 16 per GPU (global 1024), 512x288 resolution, 13 video frames (1 context + 12 prediction), 12 action timesteps per sample.

## Evaluation

The quantitative evaluation pipeline benchmarks checkpoints across the full Open-H benchmark with three metrics:

| Metric | What it measures | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| FDS (Frame Decay Score) | Pixel-level fidelity degradation over time (mean L1) | Lower is better |
| GATC (GT-Anchored Tool Consistency) | Surgical tool visual consistency vs. ground truth | Higher is better (range: -1 to 1) |
| TCD (Tool Centroid Distance) | Spatial displacement of tool instances (pixels) | Lower is better |

GATC and TCD require [Medical-SAM3](https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3) fine-tuned on [CholecSeg8k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/newslab/cholecseg8k) for surgical tool segmentation. See [`README_EVALUATION.md`](scripts/README_EVALUATION.md) for full metric definitions and evaluation pipeline documentation.
